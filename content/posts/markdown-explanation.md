There's plenty of explanation on how to write markdown on the internet. This is a reference
that you can use to check out the main elements and learn how to use them.
<!--more-->

By the way, if you want to use the first part of the post as the description, instead of
copy pasting you can use the ```html <!--more-->``` tag (checkout this post source). That will
set the content before the comment as the excerpt, and if there's no description, the excerpt will
take its place.

## Table of contents

<ul class="table-of-contents">
  <li><a href="#header">Headers</a></li>
  <li><a href="#images">Images</a></li>
  <li><a href="#links">Links</a></li>
  <li><a href="#code">Code</a></li>
  <li><a href="#quotes">Quotes</a></li>
</ul>


First, lets check out the headers


# Header
## Header
### Header
#### Header
##### Header
###### Header

You can write headers using the # sign

    # Header
    ## Header
    ### Header
    ...

and you can write blocks like that ðŸ‘† by identing the lines 4 spaces

       ...
       This is written inside of a block
       ...
